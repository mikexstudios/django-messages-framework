django-messages-framework by Django developers
backported by Michael Huynh (mike@mikexstudios.com)

"Hey, Listen!" ~Navi
------------

1. The master branch is the backport. 

2. The mirror branch is an exact mirror of django svn:
   trunk/django/contrib/comments. However, I can't think of a good reason why
   you'd want to use mirror.

Purpose:
-------

Django's messages framework is very powerful, but only available in 1.2). This
package is a backport of the messages framework for 1.1.1.

Tested:
------

Only on Django 1.1.1 and 1.1.2. Will most likely work on 1.1 too.

How to use
----------

Usage is the same as described on:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/ref/contrib/messages/

The only difference is that you replace mentions of 'django.contrib.messages'
with 'django_messages_framework'.
